    <strong>I'm Patrick German. A husband. A father. And a 2d motion graphic designer.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the name, I'm actually British, but curiously, have found myself living and working in Bonn, Germany. Fate, perhaps? Who knows...Regardless, I consider myself a global citizen, and love connecting with different people from all over the world.

While motion graphic design is my creative tool of choice, I've also had the opportunity to dabble in many other creative fields on my journey, including illustration, web design and development, photography and video production, resulting in me a being versatile and well-rounded creative. With a wide range of skills, I'm able to see a project through from beginning to completion, and my background can compliment the whole range of activities that usually accompany a motion design project.
</p>

In recent years, I've made use of that broad skill-set while working as a Senior Digital Communications Coordinator at the non-profit, <a href="https://ifoam.bio" target="_blank">IFOAM - Organics International</a>, connecting the global organic movement through videos, animations and websites.

I hope you saw something you liked in my portfolio work, and if you have a project you need some help with, or would just like to connect, I'd be happy to hear from you.
