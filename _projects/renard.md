**Renard Toys and Crafts required a new logo to help launch their first line of handmade wooden toy farms.**

*Renard* is the French word for *fox*, and so they wished to incorporate a fox character into the new logo design. The result is a playful collection of shapes, representing wooden blocks surrounding the main logo, the fox and a treated wordmark incorporating a fox tail.

<h2>Lottie Animations</h2>

Hover over the fox with your mouse cursor ;)
