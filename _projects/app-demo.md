This app demonstration video was a personal project aimed at improving my use of the C4D render engine that is built into Adobe After Effects, and how simple 3D settings can be used to effectively create a smartphone model in 3D space. The result is a clean and clear smartphone model that can have virtually any content inside, as it's simply built using a pre-composition.
