[Sleep like Sushi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZy5IPlyvboHJFmj1M6aFxg){:target="-blank"} is a youtube channel by [Katsu Suda](https://www.katsusuda.com/){:target="-blank"} featuring videos of Mr Wasabi and his Sushi friends, with musical compositions focusing on the sounds of Japan.

Katsu needed a channel brand identity, as well as an opening sequence for his videos.
