In 2019 I participated in my first [School of Motion](https://schoolofmotion.com){:target="_blank"} course, Design Bootcamp, and was therefore invited to contribute to their annual alumni Christmas 'card'. Each alumni was asked to contribute a short piece on the theme of "This holiday season, share the .....". The card received 87 submissions and can be seen [here](https://vimeo.com/381084747){:target="_blank"}.

My contribution: _'share the cosy nights'_.
